# Slides-Crop
Rapid cropping of slide images for histology analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an application that is built for increasing efficiency of a very specific use case. This is NOT a general-purpose image processing software. If you're not sure what Slides Crop does, please read the following guide to see if Slides Crop is for you!

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Slides Crop! This is an image cropping application with a friendly GUI interface. Cropping specific sections from larger images generated by Leica LAS X Widefield Systems, etc. can be a time-consuming process. Slides Crop is created so that extracting and eventually cropping the selections from a larger image is easier and more efficient.

This application is created in the Jonathan A. Epstein Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Visit our [X page](https://x.com/jonepsteinlab) or the [website of our principal investigator](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p12834)!

## 2. Quick Start
This is a quick start guide for using the application. Proceed to [section 3](#3.-Download-and-Installation) and [section 4](#4.-Tutorial) for a more detailed run-through of the application.

1. Download your operating system's executable from the [release page](https://github.com/RogerLzWang/Slides-Crop/releases).
1. Run the executable.
1. At the startup page, create a new project by entering your project's name and adjust the number of selections you need to make on each slide, along with the default selection size if needed. Hit "Create" to create a new project.
    > [!TIP]
    > Don't worry if you don't know what you want for these settings. You can change these values in subsequent steps and it is suggested to continue with the default values.
1. On the next page, click "+ Add Slides" to add all the slides you wish to process in this project. After images are added, you can click and drag the images to reorder them. If you accidentally added an incorrect image, you can right click on it to remove it. Click "Next" when all the slides are added.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The application will generate previews when you add new images. Due to the larger size of slide images, the application may freeze for minutes. Please do not force quit the application and wait patiently until images are added successfully.
1. On the next page, you will see the first slide image along with the information, including the index, file name, image size, number of selections, and the current selection size.
    1. When in View Mode (default), you can use the scroll wheel or any native motion to zoom and move the image.
    1. Holding ```Ctrl``` (```Cmd``` on macOS) enters Selection Mode. You will see the cursor change into a crosshair. Clicking on the image in selection mode creates a selection at the cursor's location.
    1. You can move a selection by clicking and dragging in View Mode.
    1. Right-click on a made selection in View Mode removes it.
    1. You can go to different slides by using the arrow buttons found in the bottom right corner.
    1. When selections have been made for one or all slides, the Export/Export All button in the bottom right corner can be used to export the selections.
1. Save the project at any time to preserve your progress.

## 3. Download and Installation

### 1. Packaged Executables
The easiest way to download and use Slides Crop is to use a packaged executable. Currently, you can find executables for both Windows and macOS in the [release page](https://github.com/RogerLzWang/Slides-Crop/releases).

### 2. Package from Soruce
The authors uses Pyinstaller to package executables. If you would like to package from source, the SPEC files used by Pyinstaller are also provided.

Before packaging, install the following dependencies (it is recommended to do so in a virtual environment):

```
pip install PyQt6
pip install Pillow
pip install darkdetect
```

Then, use Pyinstaller to package the application.

```pyinstaller spec_Windows.spec``` or ```pyinstaller spec_macOS.spec```

### 3. Run from Source
With the dependencies installed, it is also possible to directly run the application from source. Simply ```python3 main.py```.

## 5. Acknowledgments
The author is a research intern at the [Jonathan A. Epstein Lab](https://x.com/JonEpsteinLab) at the University of Pennsylvania. The work is instructed, supervised, and advised by [Diana Fulmer, PhD](https://dianafulmer.com), a postdoctoral researcher in the lab. Thanks to everyone in the Epstein Lab for making this application possible!

This application is made using Python3 and PyQt6. Pillow is used for image processing, and darkdetect is used to simplify the styling process. Internet sources are consulted and credits are given in the source code where appropriate.

## TODOs for Developers:
1. Progress bar for loading a slide (and generating previews).
1. Progress bar for exporting cropped images.
1. Drop to add slides.
1. The ability to switch themes without restarting the application.
1. Asterisk on title bar for modified project in Windows.
1. Packaged application for Linux.
